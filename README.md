## Installation

Please look up the PWA (progressive web app) installation steps for your browser and platform. If PWA is supported in that browser, you should be able to install this app like any other PWAs.

For example, on iOS Safari, you simply need to **Share** &rarr; **Add to Home Screen**.

## Notes

Please don't stress test the app. I built it mostly for my own use, so I assume all users are nice and I did very minimal input validation. If you stress test the app and weird things happen it's on you. I don't plan to add sufficient input validation in the future.

## TODOs

- Log in (with GitHub?) to sync (need to save data in some online database...)
- Push notification when the stamina is almost full
