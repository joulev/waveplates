## Notes

Please don't stress test the app. I built it mostly for my own use, so I assume all users are nice and did very minimal input validation. If you stress test the app and weird things happen it's on you. I don't plan to add sufficient input validation in the future.

## TODOs

- Log in (with GitHub?) to sync (need to save data in some online database...)
- Push notification when the stamina is almost full
